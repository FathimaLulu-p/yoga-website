        <p>Ananya Ram, the owner of <span class="mb-2 text-gray-200 text-bold">Aura Event Management Company</span>, strives to create a truly memorable experience
           for everyone on their special day. Mr. P J endeavors to spread happiness throughout Southern India on wedding days. </p>
        <br><br><br>

         <p>Nowadays, entertainment has become a crucial aspect of Southern Indian weddings, especially in Kerala. Various forms of entertainment, such as live music bands, Punjabi dances,
             flamenco dances, Sufi dances, DJs, live water drummers, and traditional Indian dances like oppana dances, bharatanatyam,  mohiniyattom and kathakali are incorporated into every part of the wedding events. 
            This entertainment is embraced by all communities, including Hindus, Christians, and Muslims. Even the Kerala Muslim community, including the Orthodox Muslim community, incorporates entertainment in their unique way.</p>
           <br><br><br>

            <p>at <span class="mb-2 text-gray-200 text-bold">Aura Event Management Company</span>, the owner, Ananya Ram, also known as Ananya Rama, takes great pride 
                in recalling a memorable wedding day organized by Aura Event Management Company. 
                The esteemed American newspaper, The New York Times, covered all aspects of the wedding event ceremony event days,
                 including the full wedding event planning, parties, and functions. This exceptional event took place in the 
                 aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                 <br><br><br>

             <p>This particular event was for Dr. Pfizer, a client of Aura Events, who is associated with the World Health Organization
                 (WHO). Dr. Pfizer’s daughter, Dr. Sheha Pfizer’s wedding planning and ceremony in Kerala, arranged by Aura Events, proves
                  that even during a pandemic, Aura Events strives to provide exceptional services for their client satisfaction. 
                  This wedding planning strictly adhered to the COVID-19 protocols and legal regulations set by the Indian government.
                   Dr. Pfizer received special care and the full support of <span class="mb-2 text-gray-200 text-bold">Aura Events wedding planners</span>  and security teams.</p>

           <p>As a leading wedding event management agency, <span class="mb-2 text-pink-700 text-bold">Aura Event Management in Kerala</span>, Southern India, provides a range of services :</p>
           <br><br>
     <h2 class="text-2xl brand text-black-800 mb-2">Design and décor </h2>
           <br>
           <p>At every wedding, design, and décor are eye-catching elements that breathe life into any bridal occasion. Most destination wedding planners in India don't conceptualize or coordinate all parts of the ceremony. 
            But we are different. As one of the top wedding planning companies in Kerala, we execute a wedding theme fully, with floral arrangements, lighting, props, and other elements according to your small or big requirements and creative vision.
             In our capacity as Kerala wedding planners, we expand our scope to provide décor services as well and engage in extensive brainstorming before demonstrating how a particular idea will meet their expectations. </p>
             <br>
             <p>We also perform cost calculations and settle for an appropriate theme from all angles.
                 We have our <span class="mb-2 text-pink-700 text-bold">own wedding decoration</span> production house and warehouse across Kerala, which makes it 
                 easier for us to handle all aspects of wedding planning and execution.</p>
                 <br><br>
     <h2 class="text-2xl brand text-black-800 mb-2">Choosing a venue and a destination</h2>
                <br>
                 <p>Finding the ideal location for your wedding can be difficult and exhausting. <span class="mb-2 text-pink-700 text-bold">Most destination </span> wedding planners in Kerala, don’t do them as well as they should. 
                    There are several restrictions that apply to this activity, including the time of the year, overall spending limits, and the availability of a venue. With these facts in mind, as the best destination wedding planners in Kerala, 
                    <span class="mb-2 text-pink-700 text-bold">Aura Event Management Company</span> coordinates with you to identify your dream location. We can make magic anyplace with reasonable <span class="mb-2 text-pink-700 text-bold">destination wedding packages in Kerala</span>, including beaches, backwaters, or the highlands.</p>
                <br><br>
     <h2 class="text-2xl brand text-black-800 mb-2">Food</h2>
               <br>
                    <p>Food is common and yet unique. We enjoy savouring various cuisines from across the world and strive to create menus and
                         meal plans that appear beautiful and surprise guests. Therefore, infuse additional individualized and thoughtful
                          components to make eating extremely interesting. Everything appears to fall into place when the cuisine is tasty
                           and presented well. Food can heavily influence wedding experiences; therefore, we collaborate with Kerala’s best
                            wedding caterer terms to bring special treats, especially to satiate your guests’ appetites. </p>
                  
                        <br><br>
                        
      <h2 class="text-2xl brand text-black-800 mb-2">Entertainment</h2>         
                        <br>
                        <p>A wedding becomes exciting and beautiful when all your favorite people are invited. Your guests are the life of the ceremony, so we ensure they are thoroughly pleased and entertained through fun activities
                             planned for the evening. We could also bring a celebrity performer to dazzle the audience. Or we could simply have games to
                              offer every age group a good time. With our wedding and entertainment services, we can bring any of these concepts 
                              to life in a way that will satisfy your guests fully. Aura's wedding planners in Kerala believe that games and 
                              activities complete any wedding, especially during the reception.</p>

                        <br><br>
      <h2 class="text-2xl brand text-black-800 mb-2">Contact and Communication</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Seamless communication is one of the most essential components of a wedding. All it takes is a little creativity to draft and design wedding
                             invitations and ensure every detail is conveyed efficiently. Everything is specially tailored and produced in 
                             accordance between? We are the leading <span class="mb-2 text-pink-700 text-bold">event management company</span> and wedding planners in Kerala, are here to make
                              it happen. </p>     
                              <br>
                              <p>with the overall theme, including the wedding logo, e-invites, photo backdrops, or kits given during the guests’ departure.
                                 We also create a wedding app or website to make their journey with you extremely comfortable. </p> 

                        <br><br>
                 <h2 class="text-2xl brand text-black-800 mb-2">Logistics</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>One of the most exhausting tasks at a wedding is managing its logistics. We offer specialised logistics services while monitoring and scheduling
                             special pick-ups for guests, including drop-offs and internal transits. Besides, we also add interesting signs,
                              snacks, and other greeting gestures to add flair to the overall atmosphere. Moreover, assistance with daily 
                              transportation for different ceremonies and other needs is provided to guests attending the wedding. We even pay 
                              attention to the most minute detail that matters a lot to family members. </p>
                              <br>
